The \"code cache\" is the work of parsing and compiling done by V8.\n\nThe ability to tap into V8 to produce/consume this cache was introduced in [Node v5.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.7.0/).\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Add the dependency:\n\n  ```sh\n  $ npm install --save v8-compile-cache\n  ```\n\n2. Then, in your entry module add:\n\n  ```js\n  require('v8-compile-cache');\n  ```\n\n**Requiring `v8-compile-cache` in Node <5.7.0 is a noop â€“ but you need at least Node 4.0.0 to support the ES2015 syntax used by `v8-compile-cache`.**\n\n## Options\n\nSet the environment variable `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` to disable the cache.\n\n## Internals\n\nThe caches are stored in `$TMP/v8-compile-cache/V8_VERSION`, where there are `.BLOB` and `.MAP` files corresponding to the entry module that required `v8-compile-cache`. The cache is _entry module specific_ because it is faster to load the entire code cache into memory at once, than it is to read it from disk on a file-by-file basis.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nSee https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache/tree/master/bench.\n\n**Load Times:**\n\n| Module           | Without Cache | With Cache |\n| ---------------- | -------------:| ----------:|\n| `babel-core`     | `218ms`       | `185ms`    |\n| `yarn`           | `153ms`       | `113ms`    |\n| `yarn` (bundled) | `228ms`       | `105ms`    |\n\n_^ Includes the overhead of loading the cache itself._\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* `FileSystemBlobStore` and `NativeCompileCache` are based on Atom's implementation of their v8 compile cache: \n  - https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b0d7a8a/src/file-system-blob-store.js\n  - https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b0d7a8a/src/native-compile-cache.js\n* `mkdirpSync` is based on:\n  - https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/blob/f2003bb/index.js#L55-L98\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"v8-compile-cache@1.0.0","_shasum":"56c809189daa8289a7d049354f61ab9c347f1fc2","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/v8-compile-cache/-/v8-compile-cache-1.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/v8-compile-cache/-/v8-compile-cache-1.0.0.tgz"}

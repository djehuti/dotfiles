These are used, when `pointfreePath` and `pointfulPath` are `pointfree.js` and `pointful.js` respectively (this is the default). If you want to use proper binaries, change package settings. If binaries are in `PATH` you may only need to remove `.js` extension.\n\nDefault shortcuts:\n\n* ctrl+alt+shift+f: toggle preview panel\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lierdakil/atom-haskell-pointfree/master/screen.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/atom-haskell-pointfree/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/atom-haskell-pointfree#readme","_id":"haskell-pointfree@0.2.0","_shasum":"81ca44cd549a6238c73450f1b055e062898fd3d0","_resolved":"file:../d-117222-24290-tbl5gj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117222-24290-tbl5gj/package.tgz"}

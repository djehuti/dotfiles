It's especially useful for OSX GUI apps, because due to an OS limitation they are not given proper env variables. This package also caches the result which results in a performance boost when a lot of packages are relying on it, it also doesn't modify the globals so using it in dependencies is safe.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save consistent-env\n```\n\n## API\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function(): Object<string, string>\nmodule.exports.async = function(): Promise<Object<string, string>>\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Unable to determine environment\n\nIf you are on OSX and using the System Default ZSH, It has a bug that causes it to live forever, thus triggering timeout\nfor `consistent-env`, to fix it you should install `zsh` using homebrew, we recommend [Rick's Guide](http://rick.cogley.info/post/use-homebrew-zsh-instead-of-the-osx-default/).\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of MIT License, see the LICENSE file for more info\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"consistent-env@1.3.0","_shasum":"8737304b1803a18a998c6075c7a09071a1ca926f","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/consistent-env/-/consistent-env-1.3.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/consistent-env/-/consistent-env-1.3.0.tgz"}

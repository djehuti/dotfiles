For each GHC version you can specify:\n\n* The path (either adding to your system path or replacing it completely)\n* The sandbox file (cabal `CABAL_SANDBOX_CONFIG` environment variable)\n* The build directory (cabal `--builddir` parameter). This defaults to `dist/`.\n\nIt also provides support for `ide-haskell`'s build target selection by reading and parsing the `.cabal` file and extracting the available targets (it uses a thin `ghcjs`-compiled wrapper around the `Cabal` library to read the `.cabal` file).\n\n## Installation and configuration\n\nPlease refer to documentation site https://atom-haskell.github.io\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-cabal/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-cabal#readme","_id":"ide-haskell-cabal@1.9.2","_shasum":"0b8885b419648f3130e1c0151ffae219a9985792","_resolved":"file:../d-117222-24254-14cvn5e/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117222-24254-14cvn5e/package.tgz"}

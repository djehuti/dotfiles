# Ben's Dotfile Repo

Here are my dotfiles, except for prezto, which is in another castle.

To install:

0. Install Git, ZSH and Ansible.
1. Clone this repo somewhere.
2. Clone [`djehuti/prezto`][prezto] somewhere nearby (a peer directory to this one works great).
   (The real requirement here is that it needs to be somewhere under `..` relative to
   the location of `setup.sh`.)
3. Run `setup.sh` in this directory. You can give a `-C` argument to
   show what would happen before doing it.
